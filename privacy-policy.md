### Security notes
- None of Azure Service Bus traffic goes to Cloud Bricks own servers. 
- All of Azure and Azure Service Bus data including messages, namespaces, topics, subscriptions are flowing from user machines (Single Page App) to Microsoft Azure relevant APIs directly without Cloud Bricks being involved.
- Users of the app can only perform actions on Service Bus entities where they are entitled to perform and after being granted permissions via Access Control (IAM).

## Data we store

Service Bus Cloud Explorer securely stores very basic information (i.e., email address) of the user who creates the SaaS subscription via Azure Marketplace. This information is shared with us securely via Azure Marketplace in association with the subscription.
Once the SaaS subscription is cancelled, this information will be permanently deleted in not more than 48 hours from cancelling the subscription.
